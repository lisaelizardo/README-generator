This README Generator will help create a README.md from the input you enter into the command line.

To use this you will need to right click on the index.js and Open in Intergrated Terminal.

Once open you will enter the code 'node .' and press enter.

It will begin with questions and you will answer them to the best of your ability for your README.

Once you are finished answering the questions a README.md will appear on the left with all the other folders/files.

Below is a quick video URL to demonstrate how to use the README Generator.
